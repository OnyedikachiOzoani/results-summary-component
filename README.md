## Challenge description

The major purpose of the challenge is to build out the product preview card component to look, as much as possible, as the design preview for desktop and mobile respectively, and in a responsive approach.

## Solution description

I've built the project to look exactly as the design preview.  
For the _mobile design_, I've set it to be visible when the **viewport width is <375px**.  
For the _desktop design_, I've set it to be visible when the **viewport width is >=375px**.

## Basic tools used

-   HTML
-   CSS

## Notable CSS properties used

-   For both the Mobile and Desktop design:
    -   Flexbox Layout

## Issues faced when building the project

-   The only problem I have in the project is a simple way to align the `footer` to be at the bottom of the page. It's container is the `body` element with `display: flex;`, `justify-content: center;`, and `align-items: center;`.  
    I think the `margin` property can do this, but with responsive design in mind, it's a problem for me. Though honestly, I didn't try to do it.
